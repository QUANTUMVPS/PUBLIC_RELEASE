## 🧠 Technical Overview

Quantum VPS Hosting Service is built around the concept of quantum-inspired data processing.  
It uses hybrid algorithms that combine classical computation models with probabilistic functions similar to quantum annealing — purely for simulation and demonstration.

Core stack includes:
- **Node.js** for backend logic  
- **PM2** for process management  
- **Nginx** for reverse proxy and routing  
- **Docker** for containerized instance hosting  
- **REST API** for developer integration
